Welcome to Blinq's Repository. Blinq is a Discord chatbot, developed with the soul purpose of collecting user message information. It collects the message-count and active minutes per channel, per guild, per member. I'm using the world "collecting", because it collects the information afterwards, it does NOT track user information.

## Frameworks
Blinq is developed on:
* Discord.js v13.0.1+
* Discord Rest API v9+

*Created with ‚ù§ by Fluxpuck*
