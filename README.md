Welcome to Blinq's Repository. Blinq is a Discord chatbot, developed with the soul purpose of collecting user message, and active minute counts per channel, and per guild. I'm using the world "collecting", because it collects the information afterwards, and does NOT track user information.

## Frameworks
Blinq is developed on:
* Discord.js v13.0.1+
* Discord Rest API v9+

*Created with ‚ù§ by Fluxpuck*
